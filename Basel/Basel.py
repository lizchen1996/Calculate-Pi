# This is a very simple way to culculate the famous number of Pi, which is very use in mathematics ans science. We can call this 'the magical number', because it appears naturally in a lot of formulas and scopes.
# With this program we calculate Pi with a technique based on numerical series called "Problem of Basel (Basilea)", which was solved by Leonhard Euler. With the solution that Euler arrived, we know that sum(1/(n^2),inf)=((pi^2)/6), so we just have to use a lot of numbers in the series to get an approximate value of Pi.
