# This is a very simple way to culculate the famous number of Pi, which is very use in mathematics ans science. We can call this 'the magical number', because it appears naturally in a lot of formulas and scopes.
# With this program we calculate Pi with the Montecarlo's method, which consists in calculating the area of the circle in respect to a square. This method works by getting random points, and after obtaining many, calculate the proportion of how many fell within the area. Knowing this we have an approximate proportion of the area of the circle with respect to the area of the square on which it is inscribed.
