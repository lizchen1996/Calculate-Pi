# Calculating Pi
In this project we see tree methods to calculate the maginal number of PI with Python code. In each folder you will find the code for each method, and an explanation of that method in a Readme file.

These are not the only methods that allow you to achieve Pi, but they are the most popular. Also, I have to say that the methods are not perfect and the precision of Pi depends on the parameters set during the execution of the script (in some methods, such as the polygons one, it is possible to specify a exacly range where the value of Pi is). My favourite methods is the polygons method, because is very easy to understand and it is very easy to get a range where the value of pi really is. Also, I like the Montecarlo's method beacuse is very powerfull, but requiere a lot of time to calculate a reasonable amount of significant numbers. 

Now, the methods in this repository are:
- Method of polygons
- Montecarlo's method
- Mehod of the Basel problem
